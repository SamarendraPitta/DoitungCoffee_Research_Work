Doi Tung Coffee Research Project

Overview
This project explores the evolution of coffee plantations in Doi Tung, Thailand. The research focuses on analyzing and understanding the development and characteristics of coffee cultivation in this region.

Methodology
Data Collection:

Data was extracted from various sources using web scraping techniques. This approach ensured a comprehensive dataset reflecting the diverse aspects of coffee plantations in Doi Tung.
Data Preprocessing:

The collected data underwent preprocessing to clean and format it for analysis. This step involved handling missing values, normalizing text, and other necessary data preparation tasks.
Topic Modeling:

The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm was applied to identify the frequency and dominant topics within the dataset. LDA is a powerful topic modeling technique that helps in discovering the underlying themes present in a large corpus of text.
Visualization:

The results of the LDA analysis were visualized using various techniques:
Word Cloud: Displays the most frequently occurring words, providing a quick overview of key terms.
Intertopic Distance Map: Created using multidimensional scaling, this map visualizes the relationships and distances between topics, highlighting their similarities and distinctions.
Bar Graphs: Illustrates the frequency and significance of the topics identified.
